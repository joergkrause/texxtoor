No changes have been made to the original edition’s text, including references to the color of the original images, which appear black and white in this book. What follows is the Introduction that originally appeared in <em class="citetitle">Programming Windows Phone 7</em>; <a class="xref" href="pr02s05.html" title="Code Samples">Code Samples</a> is the only section in this Introduction that has been updated.</p></div><p>This book is a gift from the Windows Phone 7 team at Microsoft to the programming community, and I am proud to have been a part of it. Within the pages that follow, I show you the basics of writing applications for Windows Phone 7 using the C# programming language with the Silverlight and XNA 2D frameworks.</p><p>Yes, <em class="citetitle">Programming Windows Phone 7</em> is truly a free download, but for those readers who still love paper—as I certainly do—this book will also be available (for sale) divided into two fully-indexed print editions: <em class="citetitle">Microsoft Silverlight Edition: Programming Windows Phone 7</em> and <span class="emphasis"><em>Microsoft XNA Framework Edition: Programming Windows Phone 7</em></span>.</p><p>With the money you’ve saved downloading this book, please buy other books. Despite the plethora of information available online, books are still the best way to learn about programming within a coherent and cohesive tutorial narrative. Every book sale brings a tear of joy to an author’s eye, so please help make them weep overflowing rivers.</p><p>In particular, you might want to buy other books to <span class="emphasis"><em>supplement</em></span> the material in this book. For example, I barely mention Web services in this book, and that’s a serious deficiency because Web services are likely to become increasingly important in Windows Phone 7 applications. My coverage of XNA is limited to 2D graphics and while I hope to add several 3D chapters in the next edition of this book, I don’t really get into the whole Xbox LIVE community aspect of game development. Nor do I discuss any programming tools beyond Visual Studio—not even Expression Blend.</p><p>My publisher Microsoft Press has a couple additional Windows Phone 7 books coming soon: <em class="citetitle">Windows Phone 7 Silverlight Development Step by Step</em> by Andy Wigley &amp; Peter Foot offers a more tools-oriented approach. Although Michael Stroh’s <em class="citetitle">Windows Phone 7 Plain &amp; Simple</em> is a guide to <span class="emphasis"><em>using</em></span> the phone rather than developing for it, I suspect it will give developers some insights and ideas.</p><p>Moreover, I also hear that my old friend Doug Boling is working hard on a Windows Phone 7 enterprise-programming book that is likely to be considered his masterpiece. Be sure to check out that one.</p><div class="sect1" title="Organization"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="organization"/>Organization</h1></div></div></div><p>This book is divided into three parts. The first part discusses basic concepts of Windows Phone 7 programming using example programs that target both Silverlight and the XNA framework. It is likely that many Windows Phone 7 developers will choose either one platform or the other, but I think it’s important for all developers who have at least a <span class="emphasis"><em>little</em></span> knowledge of the alternative to their chosen path.</p><p>The second part of this book focuses entirely on Silverlight, and the third part on XNA 2D. For your convenience, the chapters in each part build upon previous knowledge in a progressive tutorial narrative, and hence are intended to be read sequentially.</p></div></div></body></html>
